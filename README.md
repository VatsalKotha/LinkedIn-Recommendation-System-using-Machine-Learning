**Online professional social networks like LinkedIn are crucial
in assisting both employers and job seekers in connecting with
qualified prospects. The purpose of LinkedIn's employment
ecosystem is to provide tools for connecting job seekers and
employers, as well as to act as a marketplace for effective
matching between prospective candidates and job posts. A key
tool for achieving these objectives is LinkedIn's job suggestions
product, which presents members with individualized lists of
suggested job postings based on the structured, context-specific
information in their profiles.
The LinkedIn Recruiter product provides a ranked list of
candidates corresponding to a search request in the form of a
query, a job posting, or a recommended candidate. Given a
search request, candidates that match the request are selected
and then ranked based on a variety of factors (such as the
similarity of their age, gender, work experience/skills with the
search criteria, job posting location, and the likelihood of a
response from an interested candidate) using machine-learned
models in multiple passes.**
